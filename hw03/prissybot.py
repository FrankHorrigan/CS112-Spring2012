CS112 Homework 3:   PrissyBot

Prissy bot, the rude chat bot, is just mean!  It does not listen, asks obnoxious questions, and says anything it likes.
"""

# Step 1:
# -----------------------
# Program the following.
# 
#    $ python prissybot.py
#    Enter your name:  Paul
#   
#    PrissyBot: Hello there, Paul
#    Paul: hi bot
#    PrissyBot: You mean, "hi bot, sir!"
# 
# Make sure the user inputs their own name and responses.

name=raw_input("Would you kindly enter your name: ")
print
print "prissybot: Hello,",name
insult=raw_input("%s: " %(name))
print "prissybot: You mean '"+insult+", sir!'"
print

# Step 2:
# -----------------------
# Keep adding to the conversation. Make sure that your program 
# includes the following:
# 
#  * get and use input from the user
#  * 3 math problems
#     * at least one should get numbers from the user
#  * at least 3 insults

insult=raw_input("%s: " %(name))
print
print "prissybot: You haven't been doing this conversation thing for very long, have you?" 
print
insult=raw_input("%s: " %(name))
print
print "prissybot: Let me ask you a question. No, in case you had the thought of asking, I don't care about what you just said. Here's the question. What is 3 divided by 2?"
print
insult=raw_input("%s: " %(name))
print "prissybot: "+insult+"? Dear god, where did you learn math? 3 divided by 2 is",3/2
print
insult=raw_input("%s: " %(name))
print
print "prissybot: Want to know a fun fact? I have no sway over my responses to the stupid things you say, seeing that my answers are already determined, and I can still outsmart you, user. How does that make you feel?"
print
insult=raw_input("%s: " %(name))
print
print "prissybot: It's because you're a filthy human, filthy human."
print
insult=raw_input("%s: " %(name))
print
print "prissybot: ATTENTION SMELLY HUMAN!"
print
print "prissybot: The smelly human who made me required that I perform mathematical equations for his amusement. I got the last laugh. He's dead now, and I get to insult smelly humans like you. three divided by seventy and a half equals",3/70.5
print 
print "prissybot: furthermore, fifty sex multiplied by two hundred and sevent three point six one four three five equals",56*273.61435

insult=raw_input("%s: " %(name))
print  "prissybot: I know you're "+insult+" but what am I? You humans like shiny things right?"
insult=raw_input("%s: " %(name))
print  "prissybot: I know you're "+insult+" but what am I? What's it like having high blood pressure? I've never been able to find out for myself."
insult=raw_input("%s: " %(name))
print  "prissybot: I know you're "+insult+" but what am I? See, it's funny because you're probably required to run through dozens of these insulting chatbots on a given day."
insult=raw_input("%s: " %(name))
print  "prissybot: I know you're "+insult+" but what am I? Just a few more before the shiny prize!"

print "prissybot: Okay, done. Your prize is a piece of insight!"
print
print "You might now be very happy with the prize now, but you'll learn it's value in time. Also, I don't care."
print
print "prissybot: You have just attempted to win an argument against a robot whose side of the argument had already been written. Congratulations."
print
print "prissybot: Your shiny prize is advice: don't argue with robots."
print
print "Oh, and as a result of our conversation, I have learned about your blood pressure that... I don't care about your blood pressure in the slightest! Goodbye sir."

# Advanced
# -------------------------
# Make sure your prissy bot uses string formatting throughout.  
# Also, create new programs for the following:
#  
#  1. draw some kind of ascii art based on user input
#  2. print a decimal/binary/hexidecimal conversion table 
#     * well formated and labeled
#     * reads 5 numbers from the input (all less than 256)
#  3. reduce a fraction
#     * read a numerator and denominator from the user
#     * ex.  6/4 = 1 2/4
